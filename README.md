# BXD mapping

This project is about integrating genetic diversity in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of mouse BXD inbred panel samples to reduce reference bias.

Keywords: RNA-sequencing, reads mapping, genomic/genetic variants, genome reference, mouse, BXD panel, eQTL

# Goal

This repository serves to backup and organize my code.
